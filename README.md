# Course Platform Project

This is a **Next.js** project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).  

It is a **course platform** designed to help users track their learning progress, interact with content, and test their knowledge.

- **Quizzes with Timer:** Take quizzes with a countdown timer to measure your knowledge.  
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive, works on desktop and mobile devices.
